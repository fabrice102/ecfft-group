# ECFFT algorithms on various prime-order fields and groups

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This code is provided as is, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. It has not been audited nor fully tested. Use at your own risk.**

This crate implements structs and traits for the ECFFT algorithms from the paper 
[Elliptic Curve Fast Fourier Transform (ECFFT) Part I: Fast Polynomial Algorithms over all Finite Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08473) 
by Eli Ben-Sasson, Dan Carmon, Swastik Kopparty and David Levit.

It is based on the [ecfft-bn254 crate](https://github.com/wborgeaud/ecfft-bn254) from [@wborgeaud](https://github.com/wborgeaud) 
and extends it in the following ways:

* Support of polynomial with coefficients in a group of prime order r, where the evaluation point are in the prime field of order r:
  * While not explicit in the original paper, it is possible to implement all algorithms in that settings, as the algorithms are linear in the coefficients.
* Concrete implementation for the scalar field of ED25519 and the associated sub-groups of the ED25519 elliptic curve, 
  in addition to the original BN254 and BLS12-381 base fields.
  * None of these fields are FFT-friendly.
  * Use of ECFFT over polynomial with polynomial coefficients being ED25519 points yield even better improvements over the naive implementation
    because
* Small refactorization to make it easier to add new concrete instantiations using macros

## Example

```rust
fn test_evaluations() {
    type P = Bn254EcFftParameters;
    // ECFFT precomputations.
    let precomputation = P::precompute();
    // Can interpolate polynomials up to degree 2^14.
    let log_n = 14;
    let mut rng = test_rng();
    // Generate a random polynomial.
    let coeffs: Vec<F> = (0..1 << log_n).map(|_| rng.gen()).collect();
    let poly = DensePolynomial { coeffs };
    // Naive evaluations.
    let evals = P::coset()
        .iter()
        .map(|x| poly.evaluate(x))
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();
    // ECFFT evaluations.
    let ecfft_evals = precomputation.evaluate_over_domain(&poly);

    assert_eq!(evals, ecfft_evals);
}
```

## Implementations

Each implementation uses precomputations for the coset and isogenies used in the ECFFT.
These precomputations are computed in `get_params.sage` and are stored in the `bn254_coset` and `bn254_isogenies` files for BN254 base field.

To implement the ECFFT for other fields, similar precomputations should be performed.

### Base field of BN254 `src/bn254.rs`

The base field of the BN254 is supported for degrees up to `2^14`.

### Base field of BLS12-381 `src/bls12_381.ts`

The base field of the BLS12-381 curve is also supported, for degrees up to `2^15`. Credits to [Saulius Grigaitis
](https://github.com/sauliusgrigaitis) for [finding a curve with 2-adicity 15](https://github.com/wborgeaud/ecfft-bn254/pull/2).

Precomputations are generated by:

```bash
# sage get_params.sage p a b output_filename
sage get_params.sage 0x1a0111ea397fe69a4b1ba7b6434bacd764774b84f38512bf6730d2a0f6b0f6241eabfffeb153ffffb9feffffffffaaab 0x1800fb41dab7368489a980e14a746abfe7c87588aac25c113301d524b734a5043bbc89dd7d0c5b41de5d348ac2e838c6 0x11c65a0a6e52b8b88366e0b0df28c6804f14f35cb833cb0d918c9e758f044d95777beb965a967af4ef518ad0618a809a bls12-381
```

### Scalar field of ED25519 `src/ed25519sc.rs`

The scalar field of ED25519 is supported for degrees up to `2^10`.

The curve needed for ECFFT (that has no relation to ED25519) was found by brute-force using `find_ec.ipynb`.

Then, precomputations are generated by:

```bash
# sage get_params.sage p a b output_filename
sage get_params.sage 7237005577332262213973186563042994240857116359379907606001950938285454250989 358411639496974511688972102234120389095655852877724179826497455556504284563 820979117428412570825388108132290158712218308953717713756580934786362626809 ed25519sc
```

This can be used for fast evaluation of polynomials of coefficients in the scalar field (we denote this by ed25519sc) 
and also in the group of the elliptic curve (we denote this by ed25519pt).


## Benchmarks

### For the base field of BN254 `benches/bn254.rs`

See the original [ecfft-bn254 crate](https://github.com/wborgeaud/ecfft-bn254)

### For elliptic curve points of ED25519 `benches/ec25519sc.rs`

Here is a comparison of the running time for the evaluation of a polynomial of degree `n-1` 
on a domain of `n` evaluation points using 3 algorithms:

- the naive evaluation in `O(n^2)` over the ECFFT `n` evaluation points (Horner algorithm)
- the naive evaluation over the `n` small evaluation points `[-n/2,...,n/2]` (Horner algorithm). 
  This is about `256/log n` faster than over the ECFFT `n` evalutaion points bacause, where the `1/log n` factor
  the scalar multiplication of a elliptic curve point with a small scalar evaluation point of `log n` bits is about
  `256 / log n` faster than when the scalar evaluation point is 256-bit long (assuming a double-and-add scalar multiplication)
- the ECFFT ENTER algorithm in `O(n * log^2 n)` over the ECFFT `n` evaluation points

There is also a benchmark for the ECFFT EXTEND algorithm alone, which is in `O(n * log n)`.

There are also benchmarks for polynomials with scalar coefficients.
But those are not included below.

| `log n` | Naive (ms)  | Classic (ms) | ECFFT (ms) | Naive/ECFFT | ECFFT/Classic |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |
